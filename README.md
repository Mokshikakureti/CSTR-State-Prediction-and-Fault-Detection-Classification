# CSTR-State-Prediction-and-Fault-Detection-Classification
1. Executive Summary
This project proposes a system state prediction based on a neural network model for a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR), along with fault detection using classification techniques. Given the inherent nonlinearity of the CSTR process, traditional methods may not suffice, warranting the adoption of nonlinear predictive techniques such as neural networks. The paper delineates the neural network model and its application in forecasting CSTR behavior within a specified horizon, elucidating the optimization procedure. Moreover, it incorporates fault detection capabilities employing classification algorithms to identify and address faults in the system. By harnessing Artificial Intelligence methods like Neural Networks, the approach aims to surmount modeling challenges and attain precise understanding of system state and simultaneously employing Machine Learning based fault detection & classification in the CSTR system.
