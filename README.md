**2. Introduction**

**2.1 Problem Statement**

Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs) play a crucial role in various chemical and industrial processes, ranging from pharmaceutical manufacturing to wastewater treatment. Their widespread application underscores the importance of ensuring efficient operation and timely fault detection to maintain process safety, product quality, and operational efficiency. Traditional methods for state estimation and fault detection in CSTRs often rely on physics-based models and rule-based approaches. While effective, these methods may struggle to capture the complex and non-linear dynamics inherent in real-world CSTR systems. Additionally, they can be sensitive to model inaccuracies and uncertainties, limiting their robustness in practical applications.
To address these challenges, there has been a growing interest in leveraging advanced computational techniques, particularly neural networks (NN) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, for predictive state estimation and fault detection in CSTR systems. Neural networks offer the capability to model complex non-linear relationships and dynamics, making them well-suited for accurate state prediction based on historical process data. Meanwhile, ML classification methods provide efficient tools for distinguishing between normal operating conditions and various fault scenarios, thereby enabling proactive fault detection and mitigation strategies.
